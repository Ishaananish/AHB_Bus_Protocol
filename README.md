# AHB Bus Protocol

The Advanced High-Performance Bus (AHB) is a widely used bus protocol in the field of digital design and computer architecture. This repository provides a detailed description and resources related to the AHB protocol.

## Introduction

The Advanced High-Performance Bus (AHB) is an industry-standard bus protocol used for designing high-performance digital systems. It is commonly used for on-chip communication in various embedded systems, CPUs, and SoCs (System-on-Chip). This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of the AHB protocol, its working principles, and how it can be implemented in digital design projects.

## Features

- **High Performance:** AHB is designed for high-speed communication, making it suitable for systems with demanding performance requirements.

- **Master-Slave Architecture:** AHB supports a master-slave architecture, allowing multiple bus masters to communicate with multiple bus slaves.

- **Split Transactions:** AHB transactions are split into address and data phases, allowing for improved pipelining and performance optimization.

- **Multiple Transfer Types:** AHB supports various types of transactions, including read, write, burst, and single transfers.
